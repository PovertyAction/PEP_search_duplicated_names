# Caveats to consider when running find_duplicates.exe

* The app is still being tested. This is not a final version.
* To download, click on the .exe in this page and then click on the ‘download’ button
* Windows will show warning when opening .exe. Please click on 'More info' and then 'Run anyway'.
* After double clicking on the .exe, the application will take a bit to load (~15 sec.)
* If app shows ‘Windows not responding’, it is probably not an error, but just program working in the back.
